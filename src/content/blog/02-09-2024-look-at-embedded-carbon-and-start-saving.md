**CO2-ledIT Procurement Strategy**

There’s anew player in town within the IT landscape: CO2. Recent regulations andpolicies in the EU are embracing sustainability in IT and encouragingbusinesses to track their carbon footprint.

It’s achallenging yet fascinating topic. Why? Because, in my experience, traditional“spend-based” procurement strategies now have an alternative or complementarymetric—embodied carbon!

At NGHS, wefocus on hardware (storage, networking, servers). We have already completedseveral projects with our partners, where we created business cases centered onservers and storage. Our main metrics were CO2 embodied carbon and po

werefficiency.

The resultswere impressive! By focusing on CO2 metrics, we identified areas of savings andprovided calculations on CO2 avoidance.

The main gains:

*   The partner decided to use refurbished equipment in 20% of the initial BOM (Bill of Materials).
    

*   Change of CPU models based on energy efficiency without compromising performance.
    

*   Partner traded-in equipment that was supposed to be phased out by new deliveries.
    

*   A full report of CO2 avoided and embodied carbon in procured equipment was provided.
    

*   Savings of around 35% were achieved compared to the initial BOM, which was based entirely on new equipment.
    

Upcomingregulations will introduce Scope 4, which means companies will need to reporton CO2 emissions avoided in their IT operations. It’s time to get ready.

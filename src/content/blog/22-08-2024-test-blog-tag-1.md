# The Complete Guide to Markdown Formatting

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using a plain-text editor. It's widely used in documentation, blogs, and content management systems. In this guide, we'll explore all the **text formatting** options available in Markdown.

## 1. Text Styles

### **1.1 Bold Text**

To make text bold, enclose it in double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`):

- **This text is bold**.
- __This text is also bold__.

### **1.2 Italic Text**

To italicize text, enclose it in single asterisks (`*`) or single underscores (`_`):

- *This text is italic*.
- _This text is also italic_.

### **1.3 Bold and Italic Combined**

You can combine bold and italic by using a mix of asterisks and underscores:

- ***This text is bold and italic***.
- ___This text is also bold and italic___.

## 2. Headings

Markdown supports six levels of headings, which are created by prefixing the text with one or more `#` symbols:

```markdown
# H1 Heading
## H2 Heading
### H3 Heading
#### H4 Heading
##### H5 Heading
###### H6 Heading
